# LITANY 

Be better. Be unimpeachable. Set the baseline. Be there first. 

Ritualise. Remember the value of routine. Remember the value of improvisation— of being truly present. Test your limits, regularly. Edit ruthlessly. Live your words (as in your life, so in your writing, and vice versa). Kill cruft. 

Pursue the company of people who inspire and nourish you. Give back, pay forward. Stress begets stress— when it comes to you, transform it into something else. Find and create spaces that reflect your inner state, your ideals. Find the best fuel for body, mind and soul. You are what you consume. 

Consider your faculties and talents as batteries— know when and how to recharge them. Say NO, so you can say yes to the more important things. Remember why you do the work. Return to your core "why?" regularly. Live the balance between intention and intuition. Let discipline guide you to your muse. 

Acquit your debts and obligations. Do everything you can today to earn your future freedom. Today is the foundation for tomorrow— invest at least some part of it in the things you say you want to achieve. Remove everything that takes you away from the things you should be doing— your reason for being. 

Remember (and celebrate) your difference. Imagine yourself as powerful enough to leave a dent on the universe. Earn that power.
